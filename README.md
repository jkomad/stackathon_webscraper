### Description:

#### In this project, I explore the Puppeteer library available through Node.js and use a combination its built-in libraries and my knowledge of DOM manipulation and recursion to create headless web scrapers that extract data and provide meaningful insights on a few popular websites (i.e., Barnes and Noble, Metacritic, Rotten Tomatoes, etc...)
